# This exercise first asks the user for an input, then tells the user if its even, odd, or divisible by 4. It then asks for the user for two numbers, and tells if the latter number is a factor of the former.

# This functions tells the user if a number they chose is even, odd, or divisible by four
def even_odd_fours ():
  number = int(input("Pick a number ")) #Asks user for number
  decider = number%2 #Carries the modulus 2 for the number, identifying if its odd or even
  if decider==0 and int(decider)%2==0: . 
    print("That number is divisible by 4!") # If modulus 2 is 0 and the modulus 2 of the resulting number also has a modulus 2 of 0, the number is divisible by 4
  elif decider == 0: #if modulus 2 is 0, number is even
    print("That's an even number!")
