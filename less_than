# In this exercise, we create a function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list of integers that are less than a number given by the user

def less_than(num_list): 
  target = int(input("Give me a number ")) #ask user for target integer
  return [i for i in num_list if i<target] #create and return list of integers from original list that are less than target integer
